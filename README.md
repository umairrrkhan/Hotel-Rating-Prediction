# LSTM-based Hotel Rating Prediction from TripAdvisor Reviews

## Project Overview

This project involves building a predictive model using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks to predict hotel ratings based on text reviews collected from TripAdvisor. The goal is to create a model that can accurately predict the ratings given by customers to various hotels, which can be valuable for both hotel owners and potential customers.

The project primarily utilizes Python programming language and popular libraries such as numpy, pandas, nltk, and TensorFlow for deep learning. The dataset used for this project is named `tripadvisor_hotel_reviews.csv`.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into several key steps, including data preprocessing, model development, training, and evaluation. Below is a brief overview of each step:

1. **Importing Libraries**: Import the necessary libraries such as numpy, pandas, re, nltk, Tokenizer, pad_sequences from TensorFlow, and others for data manipulation, text preprocessing, and model building.

2. **Loading the Dataset**: Read the dataset `tripadvisor_hotel_reviews.csv` using the `pd.read_csv()` function from pandas. This dataset contains reviews and corresponding hotel ratings.

3. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Text Cleaning: Remove any special characters, numbers, and unnecessary whitespace from the reviews using regular expressions.
   - Tokenization: Split the reviews into individual words or tokens.
   - Stopword Removal: Use the NLTK library to remove common stopwords that do not contribute much to the meaning.
   - Text Vectorization: Convert the tokenized reviews into sequences of integers using the Tokenizer class from TensorFlow.

4. **Train-Test Split**: Split the preprocessed data into training and testing sets using the `train_test_split()` function from scikit-learn.

5. **Model Architecture**:
   - Build an LSTM-based neural network model using the TensorFlow Keras API.
   - Define the layers, including an Embedding layer, LSTM layer(s), and a Dense output layer.

6. **Model Training**:
   - Compile the model by specifying loss function, optimizer, and evaluation metrics.
   - Train the model on the training data using the `model.fit()` function.

7. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Evaluate the trained model on the testing data to assess its performance.
   - Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score can be used to measure the model's performance.

8. **Results and Interpretation**:
   - Analyze the model's performance metrics and make observations about its effectiveness in predicting hotel ratings.

9. **Conclusion**:
   - Summarize the project's findings and the performance of the LSTM-based model.
   - Discuss potential further improvements or directions for future work.

## Getting Started
